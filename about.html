	<h1>A little bit about me</h1>

	<p>I am a Senior at Eastern Washington University getting a General Business Management degree, I also plan to minor in Visual Communication Design. In High School I participated in D.E.C.A, and was leader of the schoolâ€™s National Art Honor Society. I even Spent the Summer in Germany with some of my fellow classmates through the international German American Partnership program Living in a rural area often meant having the internet going out for days at a time. People thought the hundreds of hours of doodling I did was odd, but a girl must keep her sanity somehow when deprived of clumsy kitten videos. I like an odd mix in my designs. My love of petticoats and parasols work their way in to my monster slaying fighter.</p>
